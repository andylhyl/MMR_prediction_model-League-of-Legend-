# MMR_prediction_model-League-of-Legend- 🎮

This project delves into the extraction, analysis, and modeling of player data from the League of Legends (Riot Games) API. The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to estimate a player's Matchmaking Rating (MMR) based on their in-game behaviors, performance, ranks, and other associated metrics.

## Data Sources 🌍:
**Riot Games API**: Player data is primarily sourced from the League of Legends API provided by Riot Games. For effective execution of the notebooks, an API key from Riot Games is essential. Secure your API key [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/).

## Notebooks 📓:
1. **data_extraction_to_sql.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook will manages the extraction of data from the Riot API and its storage into a MySQL database.
2. **data_cleaning_modeling.ipynb**: This notebook will include the full data cleaning process, preliminary analyses, and the construction of the MMR prediction model.


## Acknowledgements 🙏:
- A great thanks to **Riot Games** for granting access to their comprehensive player data.
- Great thanks to the open-source community for the invaluable Python libraries and tools too, which form the backbone of this project.
